# Turtle-Kojo-Arduino-Bridge

A bridge between the Kojo software and the Arduino Oddbot to control the Oddbot simultaneously with the simulated turtlebot in Kojo.

## Getting Started

In order to have this project up and running, Kojo and Arduino IDE 1.0.5 is needed. The instructions for Kojo ka-bridge needs to be done for the Arduino. Replace the original ka-bridge with the ka-bridge from this repo.

### Prerequisites

Set up the Arduino board for the Oddbot like the picture below.

## The Project

This project lets you control the Arduino Oddbot similtaneously with the Kojo turtlebot through a GUI in Kojo.



## Further development

The set up and the Oddbot supports further development using sensors.
